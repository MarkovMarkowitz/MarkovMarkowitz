        "It explains how risk-averse investors can construct portfolios to optimize or maximize expected return based on a given level of market risk. <a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Markowitz\">Harry Markowitz</a> pioneered this theory in his paper <a href = \"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1952.tb01525.x\">Portfolio Selection</a> , which was published in the Journal of Finance in 1952. He was later awarded a Nobel Prize for his work on modern portfolio theory. Modern Portfolio Theory suggests diversification of all your securities and asset classes and not putting all your eggs in one basket. It emphasises the importance of portfolios, diversification, risk and the connections among different kinds of securities.\n",

        "Volatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security. Volatility is often measured as either the standard deviation or variance between returns from that same security or market index.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Variance and Standard Deviation <a name=\"type_vol\"></a>\n",
        "\n",
        "Investors have to keep volatility in mind as well when choosing an investment. For example, a pension fund may need to be extra careful with its money and will want to ensure they aren’t getting into any extremely volatile investments. There are also hedge funds, which short stocks and even trade volatility with options. As you can see, whether you’re risk-seeking or risk-averse, the volatility (risk) of an investment is something you should care about.\n",
        "\n",
        "A simple measure of volatility is the variance. Variance is used to see how far away each data point in a set is away from the mean. Variance is calculated with the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "Take the difference between each data point and the mean Square each difference so that they're all positive values Sum up the squared results Divide this by the count of data points minus one $\\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum(x_i - \\overline{x}^2)}{n-1}$\n",
        "\n",
        "where\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\sigma^2 = \\textrm{Sample Variance}$\n",
        "\n",
        "$x_i = \\textrm{value of one observation}$\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\overline{x} = \\textrm{mean of all observations}$\n",
        "\n",
        "$n = \\textrm{number of observations}$\n",
        "\n",
        "The larger the variance, the further spread out it is from the mean. Variance treats all deviations from the mean the same way, regardless of whether they are less than or greater than the mean. A variance of zero would indicate that each data point is the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "Standard deviation is easy to calculate once you have the variance. All you have to do is take the square root of the variance:\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2}$\n",
        "\n",
        "where\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\sigma = \\textrm{standard deviation}$\n",
        "\n",
        "Standard deviation is another commonly used statistical measure to quantify market volatility. You would expect newer growth stocks to have higher standard deviations and more established blue-chip stocks to have lower standard deviations of returns. We will illustrate this by comparing daily returns from the last five years of the S&P 500 and NASDAQ, as well as Bitcoin prices. While Bitcoin isn't necessarily a growth stock, it's still very new compared to the S&P 500 and NASDAQ, so you would expect to see bigger swings in the price when compared to those two stock indices.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is illustrated below by taking the standard deviations of returns over the last five years. These results are as expected: Both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ have very similar daily standard deviations. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has almost five times the standard deviation of the two stock indices.\n",

        "## Managing Portfolio Variance and Portfolio Variance Formula <a name=\"manpor\"></a>\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to try to minimize portfolio variance, a good starting point is the formula itself to calculate variance with a two-asset portfolio.\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\textrm{Portfolio Variance} = w_x^2 \\sigma_x^2 + w_y^2 \\sigma_y^2 + 2w_x w_y Cov_{x,y}$\n",
        "\n",
        "where\n",
        "\n",
        "* $w_x$ = portfolio weight of asset x\n",
        "* $w_y$ = portfolio weight of asset y\n",
        "* $\\sigma_x$ = standard deviation of asset x\n",
        "* $\\sigma_y$ = standard deviation of asset y\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "With this information in mind, there are 3 things we can do to minimize variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. We can pick assets with lower standard deviations of returns. This may seem obvious, but if we really want to reduce the variance of our portfolio, the simplest thing to do is just pick assets that have relatively low volatilities.\n",
        "2. Invest a higher percentage of your portfolio into your less risky asset(s). For our previous example with JPM and Bitcoin, we could further reduce our portfolio variance by investing a bigger portion of our funds into JPM since it had a lower standard deviation than Bitcoin.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sometimes, it's the case that an investor may still want to invest in a riskier asset like Bitcoin. This brings us to the third thing we can do to reduce variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Check for assets with a low covariance. If you look at the right side of our portfolio variance function, you'll notice we have the covariance of two assets as a function parameter. If we can reduce that, we can reduce the overall variance of our portfolio.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is an important point and should be expanded upon further.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Covariance-Correlation Relationship\n",
        "If you recall from a previous lesson, the formula for correlation is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\rho_{x,y} = \\frac{Cov_{x,y}}{\\sigma_x*\\sigma_y}$\n",
        "\n",
        "We can rearrange this to get the covariance formula:\n",
        "\n",
        "$Cov_{x,y} = \\rho_{x,y}\\sigma_x\\sigma_y$\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, we can plug this back into our portfolio variance formula:\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\textrm{Portfolio Variance} = w_x^2 \\sigma_x^2 + w_y^2 \\sigma_y^2 + 2w_x w_y \\rho_{x,y}\\sigma_x\\sigma_y$\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "These formulas are basically to show that we need to minimize correlations in order to minimize portfolio variance. Owning uncorrelated assets illustrates the efficient benefits of diversification. Let's write some reusable functions to sum up the work we did above and really display how this works with a few examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "As seen in the formula, in order to minimize portfolio variance we need to minimize the covariance term. And this can be done by minimization coefficents of this covariance term\n"
