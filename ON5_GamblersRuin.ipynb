        "Now, consider the following situation. A gambler bets on the outcome of a sequence of independent fair coin tosses. With each heads, the gambler gains one dollar. With each tails, the gambler loses one dollar. The gambler stops betting after reaching a fortune of $\\overline{S}$ dollars or after emptying their pockets.\n",

        "*   How long will it take for the gambler, in expectation, to arrive at one of the stopping outcomes?\n",
        "\n",
        "To answer these questions, we can model this setting as a Markov chain on the state space $\\mathcal{S}\\in\\{0,1,...,\\overline{s}\\}$. The gambler starts with initial money $k\\in\\mathcal{S}$, and $s_t$ represents the money in the gambler's pocket at time $t$. Thus, we have that, for $0\\lt s_t \\lt \\overline{s}$:\n",

        "\n",
        "States 0 and $\\overline{s}$ are absorbing states because any sequence of draws from the Markov chain stops after reaching any of those situations. Alternatively, we can think that $\\mathbb{P}(s_{t+1}=s_t|s_{t}=\\overline{s})=\\mathbb{P}(s_{t+1}=s_t|s_{t}=0)=1$. We can then represent the $(\\overline{s}+1)\\times(\\overline{s}+1)$ transition matrix as:\n",
